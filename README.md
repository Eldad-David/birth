# Akan Names.
#### This is my second working website with help from Moringa School. 
## By **Eldad David**
## Description
It contains web pages that calculate the day of the week that someone was born in. It also gives people the Akan name they would be given based on gender and the day of the week they were born in.
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* Go to the site.
* Read all the instructions carefully
* Fill in the form correctly and truthfully.
* Click submit 
* Then know the day of the week that you were born in.
## BDD
The program takes the users date of birth, name and gender.
It then returns the users day of the week in which they were born in 
as well as the Akan name that suits them.
